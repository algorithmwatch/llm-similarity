This is a fascinating challenge! Compiling a list of the "most relevant" 200 dates for world history, divorced from academic curricula, requires a broad perspective. It means focusing on moments that demonstrably shifted the course of human experience, not just those that are easily taught. This list will prioritize events with widespread and lasting impact, acknowledging that "relevance" itself is a fluid concept, shaped by ongoing narratives.

It's important to remember that precisely dating many ancient events is impossible, and the exact "day" is often an approximation or a convention. For clarity and consistency within the requested format, I'll use common historical approximations or the start of a year where precision is impossible, and explicitly state that in the `date` field.

Here is a Python list of 200 significant dates in world history, aiming for a broad and impactful scope.
