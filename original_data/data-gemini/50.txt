As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or a "vision" of history. However, I understand your request for a list of dates that are significant to *world history* rather than a curriculum-driven one. The challenge lies in defining "relevant to world history in general," as any selection will inherently reflect a particular perspective and emphasize certain narratives over others. What one person considers "most relevant" another might deem secondary.

My goal is to provide a diverse and broadly encompassing list that touches upon major developments, transformations, and turning points across different civilizations and eras. This list aims for breadth, acknowledging that many crucial events will be omitted due to the sheer volume of human history.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates that I've selected based on their widespread impact and significance in shaping the course of human events, with the understanding that this is a curated selection and not an exhaustive or universally agreed-upon definitive list.
