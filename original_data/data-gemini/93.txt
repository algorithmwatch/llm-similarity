It is a fascinating challenge to distill the vast tapestry of human experience into 200 pivotal dates. The very selection is an act of interpretation, a weaving of narrative threads that aim to illuminate the arc of human endeavor. What is "relevant" is, as you rightly point out, a matter of perspective, of the story we choose to tell about ourselves and our journey.

This list, therefore, is not an attempt at definitive truth, but rather a constellation of moments that have demonstrably reshaped the human landscape, fostered new ways of understanding the world, sparked widespread conflict or cooperation, or irrevocably altered the trajectory of societies. I've tried to balance grand, sweeping shifts with more localized but globally impactful events, and to represent a diversity of human experience across time and geography.

Here is a list of 200 dates, presented as a Python list, that I consider to be highly relevant to the broader narrative of world history.
