Here is a list of 200 dates that I believe are broadly relevant to world history, presented as a Python list of dictionaries. My selection aims to capture pivotal moments across diverse regions and themes, recognizing that "relevance" itself is a fluid concept shaped by ongoing historical interpretation. This list prioritizes events that initiated significant shifts, introduced new paradigms, or represented major turning points in human civilization.
