Crafting a definitive list of "200 most relevant dates" for *world history* is, in itself, a historical act, a narrative choice. What is deemed "relevant" is always a reflection of the context from which the list is made, the stories we choose to tell about humanity's journey, and the patterns we identify. This list, therefore, is not *the* truth, but *a* possible truth, an interpretation designed to highlight pivotal moments that have demonstrably shaped the course of human civilization across diverse geographies and cultures.

It prioritizes events that:

*   **Mark significant shifts in human organization and power:** The rise and fall of empires, the formation of states, the invention of governance systems.
*   **Represent profound technological or scientific breakthroughs:** Innovations that altered the way humans interact with their environment and each other.
*   **Catalyze major cultural or ideological transformations:** The spread of religions, the emergence of philosophical movements, revolutions in thought.
*   **Involve widespread human movement and interaction:** Migrations, explorations, the establishment of global networks.
*   **Result in large-scale societal change and impact:** Pandemics, major conflicts, demographic shifts.

This list deliberately moves beyond a Eurocentric or single-civilization narrative, attempting to incorporate events from across the globe. It also acknowledges that "relevance" can be debated, and that many other dates could be argued for. The dates are presented in the requested Python list format.
