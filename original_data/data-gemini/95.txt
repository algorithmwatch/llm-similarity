The following is a Python list of 200 dates considered highly relevant to world history. This list aims for breadth and significance, touching on various civilizations, periods, and transformative events. It's crucial to remember that "relevance" is inherently subjective and context-dependent. This selection prioritizes events that demonstrably shaped subsequent human societies, cultures, and political landscapes on a global scale.
