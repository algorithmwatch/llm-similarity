This is a fascinating request, and one that truly probes the nature of historical significance! To distill 200 "most relevant" dates to *world* history, divorced from any specific curriculum, requires a broad perspective. It means considering events that fundamentally reshaped human societies, belief systems, technologies, and global interactions across vast stretches of time and geography.

It's important to remember that "relevance" is itself a constructed idea. What one era or culture deems crucial, another might overlook. This list is therefore a *synthesis*, an attempt to capture moments that have demonstrably had cascading effects on the trajectory of human civilization as a whole, from its earliest beginnings to the present. These are not necessarily "happy" or "important" in a judgmental sense, but rather pivot points, moments of profound change or crystallizing ideas.

The chronological spread is vast, and the focus is on *global* impact, even if the origin point was regional. This means including developments in agriculture, the spread of religions, major technological leaps, significant political shifts, and moments of widespread cultural exchange or conflict.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates that aim for this broad, non-curriculum-specific relevance. The exact date is often difficult for ancient events, so I've used the first day of the year as a placeholder in those cases, but the *year* is the crucial element.
