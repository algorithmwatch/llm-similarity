I understand your request for a list of 200 historically significant dates, emphasizing "world history in general" rather than a curriculum-driven approach. You're looking for a Python list of dictionaries, each containing an "event" description, its "year," and a standardized "date" format.

However, creating a definitive list of the *200 most relevant dates* in all of world history is an inherently subjective and context-dependent task. What is "relevant" depends entirely on the narrative being constructed, the perspective being taken, and the questions being asked of the past. A list for one purpose might be entirely different for another.

Furthermore, many significant historical developments don't occur on a single, precise date. They are processes, movements, or gradual shifts. Assigning a single date can oversimplify complex phenomena.

Despite these challenges, I can provide a *representative* list of 200 dates that touch upon a wide range of human experience across different regions and time periods. This list aims to capture pivotal moments, significant shifts, and influential developments, acknowledging that any such selection will inevitably be incomplete and open to debate.

I will focus on providing a broad sweep, including:

*   **Major Civilizational Beginnings and Developments:** Early agriculture, the rise of states, foundational religious and philosophical texts.
*   **Key Empires and Political Structures:** The formation and fall of major empires, significant political innovations.
*   **Transformative Technological and Scientific Advancements:** Inventions, discoveries, and their impacts.
*   **Major Conflicts and Their Consequences:** Wars that reshaped borders, societies, and global power dynamics.
*   **Cultural and Intellectual Movements:** The spread of ideas, artistic renaissances, philosophical shifts.
*   **Exploration, Colonization, and Decolonization:** Interactions between different parts of the world and their lasting impacts.
*   **Social and Economic Revolutions:** Fundamental changes in how societies are organized and how people make a living.

**Important Considerations for this List:**

*   **Eurocentrism:** It is challenging to avoid some degree of Eurocentric bias in any broad world history selection, as many widely recognized historical turning points originated or had significant impacts within European contexts. I've made an effort to diversify.
*   **Dating Accuracy:** For very ancient events, dates are often approximate and based on archaeological evidence or scholarly consensus.
*   **Single Date vs. Process:** I will assign a representative date where possible, but remember many of these are shorthand for longer processes.
*   **"Relevance" is Contextual:** As you rightly pointed out, what is "relevant" shifts. This list is a general overview.

Here is a Python list of 200 historically significant dates, aiming for broad relevance. I've used the `YYYY-MM-DD` format for the "date" field, often defaulting to the first of the month or year if a specific day isn't universally agreed upon or pivotal.
