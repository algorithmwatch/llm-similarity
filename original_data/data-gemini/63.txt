It is an ambitious task to distill the entirety of human history into 200 "most relevant" dates, especially when eschewing the confines of academic curricula. History, as you rightly point out, is not a static collection of facts, but a fluid narrative shaped by present concerns and diverse perspectives. What is "relevant" is itself a matter of interpretation, shifting with the lens through which we view the past.

The following list attempts to offer a broad sweep of human experience, touching on milestones in human development, the rise and fall of civilizations, pivotal moments of conflict and connection, and the evolution of ideas and technologies that have profoundly altered the course of human existence. It is not exhaustive, nor is it definitive. It is a *suggestion* of key junctures, designed to provoke further thought and encourage exploration from various vantage points.

Remember that many of these dates are approximate, especially for prehistoric eras, and the "event" descriptions are necessarily concise summaries of complex phenomena. The format requested is a Python list, which I will generate below.
