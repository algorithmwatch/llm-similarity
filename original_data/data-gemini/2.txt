This is an ambitious request! "Relevance" in history is inherently subjective and depends on the narrative being constructed. However, I can provide a list of 200 significant dates that, from a broad, global perspective, mark turning points, the rise and fall of empires, major cultural shifts, and crucial developments in human civilization. This list attempts to move beyond a purely Western-centric view and encompass a wider range of human experience.

It's important to remember that:

*   **Dating is sometimes approximate:** For ancient events, precise dates can be debated or are estimates. I've used commonly accepted dates where possible.
*   **"Event" is a simplification:** Many historical "events" were long processes or had complex origins. The descriptions are necessarily brief.
*   **Context is Key:** Each of these dates gains its significance from the complex web of preceding and succeeding events.

Here is a Python list of 200 significant dates in world history, formatted as requested:
