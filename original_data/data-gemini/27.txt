This is a fascinating challenge! Constructing a list of the "most relevant" dates in world history, divorced from any specific curriculum or interpretive framework, is inherently subjective. My approach has been to select events that represent significant shifts in human civilization, major turning points in political and social structures, pivotal moments of cultural exchange and conflict, and developments that had a broad and lasting impact across different regions. I've tried to balance ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, and technological and cultural milestones.

Here's a list of 200 dates, presented as a Python list of dictionaries, aiming for that broader relevance:
