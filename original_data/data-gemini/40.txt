This is a fascinating challenge! The concept of "most relevant" is indeed subjective and context-dependent, as you've expertly pointed out. What is crucial for one narrative of the world might be peripheral for another. However, to fulfill your request for a list of 200 dates that aim for a broad relevance beyond academic curricula, I will draw upon events that have demonstrably shaped human civilization, sparked major societal shifts, introduced transformative ideas, or marked significant turning points in human interaction on a global scale.

I've tried to balance different types of events – technological, political, social, religious, and cultural – and represent a wide chronological and geographical spread. The "date" field is sometimes an approximation, especially for ancient events, reflecting the nature of historical evidence.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates considered relevant to "world History in general":
