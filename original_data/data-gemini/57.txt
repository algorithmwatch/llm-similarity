It is a fascinating endeavor to distill 200 "most relevant" dates to world history, especially when departing from the usual academic framing. The very act of selection is a historical act, shaping a narrative, and as you've astutely noted, history is as much about what is said to have happened as what actually did. The "relevance" is inherently contextual, shifting with the perspective and the questions being asked.

To provide a list that aims for broad significance, I've tried to encompass a range of human experience: major shifts in political structures, technological innovations, cultural and religious movements, significant conflicts, and moments of profound societal change. This list is not exhaustive, nor is it definitive. It is one possible narrative, woven from threads of what has profoundly shaped the human story across diverse geographies and epochs.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates, aiming for a general relevance to the grand sweep of world history. I've included approximate dates where precise ones are debated or unknown, and I've used a standardized date format.
