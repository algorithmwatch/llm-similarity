Here is a list of 200 dates considered relevant to world history, presented from various perspectives and acknowledging that "relevance" itself is a constructed narrative. These are not necessarily the dates taught in a single curriculum but are chosen for their broad impact, the enduring questions they raise, or the significant shifts they represent in human experience.

The list is structured as a Python list of dictionaries, as requested.
