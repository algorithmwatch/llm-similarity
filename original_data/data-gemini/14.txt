This is a fascinating and challenging request, as "relevance" in world history is inherently subjective and dependent on the narrative being constructed. What one era deems pivotal, another might overlook. The dates below are selected with the aim of capturing a broad sweep of human development, technological leaps, significant societal shifts, major conflicts, and the emergence of influential ideas and cultures across different regions, avoiding a purely Eurocentric or modern bias.

It's crucial to remember that each of these dates represents complex processes, not isolated incidents. The provided "date" field is often the most commonly accepted or symbolic, but the reality of these events unfolded over extended periods.

Here is a list of 200 dates, presented as a Python list of dictionaries.
