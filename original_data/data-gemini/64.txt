You've asked for a list of dates that are "relevant to world history in general," and importantly, not just those found in a typical curriculum. This is a fascinating challenge, as "relevance" is itself a fluid concept, shaped by present-day concerns and the narratives we construct. The following list attempts to capture events that, from various perspectives, have significantly reshaped human societies, power structures, knowledge, or the very planet we inhabit. It prioritizes moments of profound change, widespread impact, or the emergence of ideas and technologies that have had long-lasting, global repercussions, even if their immediate scope was more localized.

This is not a definitive or "correct" list, as such a thing is impossible. Instead, it's a *suggested* set of anchor points that can be used to explore the vast and complex tapestry of human history from a multitude of angles.
