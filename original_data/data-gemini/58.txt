Creating a definitive list of the "200 most relevant dates" in world history is a fascinating and inherently subjective challenge. Relevance, as you've rightly pointed out, is a construct shaped by the narratives we choose to tell and the perspectives we adopt. What one culture or historian deems pivotal, another might overlook. My aim here is to offer a diverse selection that touches upon major shifts in human civilization, from early developments to contemporary events, acknowledging that many equally valid lists could be constructed.

This list prioritizes events that demonstrably altered the course of human societies on a large scale, influenced subsequent developments, or represent significant turning points in our understanding of ourselves and our world. I've tried to balance different geographical regions and thematic areas, though the sheer volume of human experience makes comprehensive representation impossible.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates, aiming for "world history in general" rather than a prescribed curriculum:
