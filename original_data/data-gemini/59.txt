Here is a list of 200 dates that are, from my perspective as a historian who understands history as a dynamic narrative shaped by context, broadly relevant to understanding the sweep of human events. This list deliberately attempts to move beyond a Eurocentric or conventionally "taught" syllabus, incorporating a wider range of global developments and perspectives.
