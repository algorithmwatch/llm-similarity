This is a fascinating and challenging request, as "most relevant" is inherently subjective and context-dependent. The dates I've selected aim to capture pivotal moments, shifts in power, major cultural and technological advancements, and events that reshaped human societies on a global scale. I've tried to avoid a purely Western-centric view and incorporate events from various regions and eras.

Here is a list of 200 dates that I believe are highly relevant to world history, presented as a Python list of dictionaries. I've focused on the *year* for most entries, as precision to the specific day can sometimes obscure the broader historical significance, or is not always definitively known for ancient events.
