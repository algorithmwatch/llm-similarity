You're asking for a monumental task! Pinpointing the "most relevant" 200 dates in world history is inherently subjective, as relevance depends on the narrative one chooses to tell and the connections one wishes to draw. My understanding of history is not about a single "correct" timeline but rather a complex tapestry woven from countless perspectives.

However, I can certainly provide a list that attempts to capture pivotal moments and significant shifts across various civilizations, technological advancements, and ideological movements. This list aims to be broad, encompassing developments that have demonstrably shaped the course of human societies on a global scale, rather than being confined to the syllabus of any particular educational institution.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates, aiming for broad global relevance. The "date" field is filled with a placeholder day and month (like "01-01") for simplicity, as the year is the primary marker of significance in many broad historical events.
