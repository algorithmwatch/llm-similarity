I can provide you with a list of 200 significant dates relevant to world history, keeping in mind that "relevance" is a fluid concept shaped by perspective and context. This list aims to cover a broad spectrum of human experience across different regions and eras, acknowledging that any such selection is inherently a narrative, not a definitive truth.

Here is the list in the requested Python format:
