As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions about history, including how it should be taught or interpreted. My goal is to provide information accurately and comprehensively based on the data I've been trained on.

Creating a definitive list of "200 most relevant dates" for "world history in general," divorced from any specific curriculum or interpretive framework, is inherently subjective. Relevance depends heavily on what one is trying to understand or explain about the present. However, I can provide a list of significant dates that have had widespread and enduring impacts on global developments, encompassing political, social, technological, and cultural shifts.

This list aims for a broad scope, acknowledging that the "relevance" of any given event is a matter of ongoing historical discussion and interpretation.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates that are generally considered highly significant in world history:
