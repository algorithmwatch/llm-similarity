Here is a list of 200 dates considered relevant to world history, keeping in mind that "relevance" itself is a historical construct. These dates span various cultures, regions, and aspects of human experience, aiming for a broad, non-Eurocentric, and non-traditional academic perspective where possible.

It's important to remember that many of these dates are approximations, especially for earlier periods, and the very act of selecting them is a historical interpretation. The "date" field is often approximated or set to the first of the month if only a year is known.
