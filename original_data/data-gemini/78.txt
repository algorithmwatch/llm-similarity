It is a fascinating challenge to distill 200 "most relevant" dates for world history, especially when stepping outside the confines of academic curricula. Relevance is inherently tied to the narratives we construct to understand our present, and those narratives are always shifting and contested. What one era deems pivotal, another might overlook.

Therefore, this list is not an absolute truth, but rather a selection of moments that have profoundly shaped the course of human experience, influencing demographics, political structures, belief systems, technological development, and our very understanding of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. I have aimed for a broad scope, encompassing diverse cultures and geographies, and acknowledging both cataclysmic and subtle shifts.

The format requested is a Python list of dictionaries. Please note that for many ancient dates, precision beyond the year is impossible. I have used a placeholder month and day (e.g., "01-01") where specific dates are unknown or debated, to fulfill the format requirement.
