Here is a list of 200 dates that, from my perspective as a historian who understands history as a dynamic narrative shaped by context, are particularly relevant to world history in its broadest sense. This list deliberately avoids being a simple chronological march of "greatest hits" and instead aims to capture moments of significant transformation, cultural exchange, technological leaps, and ideological shifts that have profoundly shaped the human story. I've strived for a global perspective, though the inherent biases of surviving records mean some regions are more represented than others.
