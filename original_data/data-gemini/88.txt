I can provide you with a list of 200 significant dates in world history, aiming for a broad relevance beyond a specific academic curriculum. However, it's crucial to understand that "relevance" is inherently subjective and context-dependent. The following list is an attempt to capture events that have had widespread and lasting impacts, influencing global trajectories.

Keep in mind that precise dates for ancient events can be debated, and some dates represent a period of time rather than a single day. I've used established approximations where necessary and opted for a common, modern date format (YYYY-MM-DD) as requested, even when the exact day might be unknown or symbolic for very ancient events (using January 1st as a placeholder in such cases).

Here is a Python list of 200 dates, reflecting events that have shaped the human story:
