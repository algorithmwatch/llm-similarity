Here is a list of 200 dates considered broadly relevant to world history, presented as a Python list of dictionaries. This selection prioritizes events with significant and lasting global impact, or those that represent major shifts in human civilization, rather than a curriculum-driven approach. The "date" field attempts to provide a specific day where commonly accepted, otherwise it defaults to a plausible date within the year.
