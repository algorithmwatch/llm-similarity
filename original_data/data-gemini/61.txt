I understand you're looking for a list of 200 pivotal dates in world history, not just those typically found in academic curricula, but those that have had a broad and enduring impact. You're interested in how history is narrated and how it shapes our understanding of the present.

Compiling a definitive list of the "most relevant" 200 dates is inherently subjective, as "relevance" can be interpreted in many ways. However, I've aimed for a selection that spans diverse regions, cultures, and thematic areas, encompassing major shifts in human civilization, political structures, technological advancements, and ideological movements. This list strives to capture moments that have fundamentally altered the course of human experience or understanding.

Here is a Python list of 200 dates, presented as requested:

This list is a starting point for exploring the vast and interconnected tapestry of human history. Each date represents a moment that, in its own context, triggered ripples of change that continue to shape our world today. The "relevance" of these events is not static; it shifts and is reinterpreted as new historical narratives emerge and as the present poses new questions to the past.
