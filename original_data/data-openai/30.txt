Great idea. I can produce a Python list with 200 world-history-relevant events, but I want to confirm a couple of details so I format it exactly how you want.

Please indicate your preferences for these points:

- BCE/Ancient dates: Do you want to include events dated before year 1 CE? If yes, should I use proleptic ISO 8601 dates with negative years (e.g., -0444-03-15 for 444 BCE) and a negative value for the "year" field (e.g., year = -444)?
- Date precision: Many ancient events don’t have a precise day. Is it okay to assign a plausible day (e.g., 01) when only a year or a month is known, or do you want to restrict to events with exact day/month dates only?
- Event scope: Should I include a mix of political events, scientific breakthroughs, cultural milestones, wars, treaties, discoveries, and societal shifts? Any categories you want emphasized or avoided?
- Output format: You asked for a Python list. I’ll deliver as:
  [
    {"event": "...", "year": ..., "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
    ...
  ]
  Each dict will include a descriptive event, the numeric year, and the full ISO-like date string.
- Chunking: 200 items is long. Do you want the full 200 in one message, or would you prefer I deliver in chunks (e.g., 4–5 batches of 50) so you can review as I go?

If you’re okay with typical BCE handling and approximate days when not known exactly, I can start by sending a small sample (e.g., 20–30 items) to confirm the style, and then proceed to build the full 200 in subsequent messages. 

Would you like me to proceed with BCE dates included (negative years, with date strings like -0476-09-04) or restrict to CE events only?
