This is doable but quite a long output (200 items). A quick check before I generate:

- BCE dates: OK to include them using negative years in the "year" field and ISO-like date strings in the "date" field? Example: 776 BCE -> year = -0775, date = "-0775-01-01" (January 1 for approximate dates).
- Date precision: For well-known exact dates I’ll use those; for approximate dates I’ll default to January 1 of the year as you specified.
- Scope: I’ll try to cover a broad, worldwide set (politics, science, religion, technology, culture) across BCE and CE.

If that looks good, I’ll generate the full Python list of 200 dictionaries in one shot. Please confirm and I’ll proceed.
