That’s a big list. I can deliver a Python list of 200 event records, but I want to align on a couple of details to make sure it matches what you want:

- BCE/ancient events: Do you want to include BCE dates (negative years) or should I restrict to CE/AD (year 1 onward) to keep the date format strictly as YYYY-MM-DD?
  - If you’re okay with BCE, I can represent them with negative years in the date field (e.g., "-0563-04-08") and a negative year value (e.g., year: -563). If you prefer, I can keep all dates as CE only.

- granularity and scope: Do you want mostly single, well-defined events with exact dates (Battle of Hastings, etc.), or is it okay to include broader milestones that are associated with a date (e.g., “Patriarchate divides” with a year and a rough month)?

- balance: Should I aim for global coverage across regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, etc.) and across eras (ancient, medieval, early modern, modern), or do you want a particular emphasis?

- batching: I can generate the 200 items in one go, or in batches (e.g., 4 batches of 50). Which do you prefer?

If you’re ready to proceed, say:
- “CE-only, batch of 50 first” or
- “Include BCE too, batch of 50 first” or
- any other preference.

I can then give you the first batch as a Python list like:
[
  {"event": "...", "year": 476, "date": "0476-09-04"},
  {"event": "...", "year": 622, "date": "0622-07-16"},
  ...
]

And then continue with the remaining items until we reach 200.
