That’s a big dataset. Before I generate 200 entries, a couple quick clarifications to make sure I produce exactly what you want:

- BCE allowed or only AD/CE events? If you want BCE events, I’ll use negative years (e.g., year -44 for 44 BCE) and ISO-like dates such as -0044-03-15 in the date field.
- How exact should dates be? For many ancient events we only know the year. I can either:
  - put a best-guess full date (e.g., 0313-03-27 for the Edict of Milan) or
  - use the date as "year-01-01" when only the year is known, clearly marking it as approximate.
- Output format: you asked for a single Python list. I can deliver all 200 in one long list, or in two (or more) batches if you’d prefer.

If you’re happy with BCE support and a consistent approach to partial dates (and you’re okay with a very long single list), I can proceed to generate the first 100 entries now and follow up with the remaining 100 in a second message. Let me know your preferences and I’ll tailor the output accordingly.
