This is a big request (200 detailed items). A couple of choices will affect how I format and deliver it:

- BCE dates: Do you want BCE events included? If yes, I’ll represent BCE years with negative year values in the "year" field and ISO-like dates in the "date" field (e.g., "-0044-03-15" for 44 BCE). If you’d prefer to restrict to AD/CE only, I can do that instead.
- Date precision: Some ancient events don’t have precise calendar dates. Do you want approximate dates (e.g., year-only or month-approx) or exact dates where known?
- Delivery format: I can output all 200 items in one Python list right away, or break them into batches (e.g., 50 items per batch) and deliver sequentially.

If you’re ready for me to proceed, tell me:
1) Include BCE dates or only CE/AD?
2) Exact vs. approximate dates for ancient events?
3) Batch delivery preferred (one go vs. 4 batches of 50)?

If you say “go with BCE included, exact dates where known, and deliver in batches of 50,” I’ll start with Batch 1 (50 items) immediately.
