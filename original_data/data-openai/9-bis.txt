I can generate a 200-item Python list for you, but I want to confirm two formatting points to avoid later back-and-forth:

- BCE handling: Do you want BCE events included? If yes, should I encode BCE years in the date field using ISO-like negative years (for example, -0450-01-01 for 450 BCE) and use negative numbers in the "year" field as well? If you’d prefer to stay CE-only, I’ll provide 200 CE-era events only.
- Date format: Is it acceptable to use years with zero padding (e.g., 0033-01-01 for 33 CE) and, for BCE, negative years like -0033-01-01? The example you gave suggests a strict YYYY-MM-DD style, but negative years are sometimes handled differently in tools.

If you’re happy with CE-only, I’ll proceed to deliver 200 concise CE-era events in a single Python list like:
[
  {"event": "Edict of Milan legalizes Christianity", "year": 313, "date": "0313-01-01"},
  {"event": "Council of Nicaea establishes early Christian doctrine", "year": 325, "date": "0325-01-01"},
  ...
]

Sample (CE-only, first 5 items) to illustrate formatting:

[
  {"event": "Edict of Milan legalizes Christianity", "year": 313, "date": "0313-01-01"},
  {"event": "Council of Nicaea establishes early Christian doctrine", "year": 325, "date": "0325-01-01"},
  {"event": "Christianity becomes state religion in the Roman Empire (Theodosius I)", "year": 380, "date": "0380-01-01"},
  {"event": "Fall of the Western Roman Empire", "year": 476, "date": "0476-01-01"},
  {"event": "Muhammad's birth (traditionally dated)", "year": 570, "date": "0570-01-01"}
]

Please confirm whether BCE events should be included and how you want them encoded. Once you confirm, I’ll generate the full 200-item list in one shot.
