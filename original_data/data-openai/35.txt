I can do that, but I want to make sure I match what you want. A couple of quick questions before I generate the 200-entry Python list:

- BCE dates: Do you want to include events before 1 CE? If yes, I’ll represent BCE years with negative integers in the "year" field and use ISO-like date strings with negative years in "date" (e.g., -0444-07-15). If you’d prefer to exclude BCE, I can limit to AD years only.

- Date precision: Some ancient events have known year but not exact day/month. Should I:
  - constrain to events with well-specified dates (day/month known), or
  - allow approximate dates when only a year or approximate month is known (and pick a representative day)?

- Coverage and emphasis: Do you want broad global coverage (Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, Oceania) with a mix of political, scientific, cultural, and economic milestones? Any topics you want to emphasize or avoid (e.g., religious events, wars, disasters, technology breakthroughs)?

- Exact count: You asked for exactly 200 items. I’ll deliver exactly 200 entries unless you tell me to adjust.

- Output format: You want a Python list of dicts like [{"event": "...", "year": ..., "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}, ...]. I’ll ensure proper Python syntax and valid strings.

If you confirm these points (especially BCE inclusion and date precision), I’ll generate the full 200-entry list in the requested format.
