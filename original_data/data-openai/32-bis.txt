That’s a big request, and I can do it, but two quick checks will help me get you exactly what you want:

- Should I include BCE dates (negative years) or limit to Common Era (CE) dates only?
- Do you want the full 200 items to cover the entire history range (from roughly 10,000 BCE to today), or should I focus on CE dates (1 CE onward) for a more concise, well-documented set?

If you’re happy with BCE dates included, I can deliver a single Python list with 200 concise events, each as a dict like:
{"event": "Event description", "year": -3100, "date": "-3100-01-01"}

If you’d rather only CE, I’ll provide 200 CE-present entries.

Would you like me to proceed with BCE-inclusive dates, or CE-only? And is there any preference on regional emphasis (global vs. more regional events) or particular eras you want to prioritize? I can start with a 20–30 item sample in the requested format to confirm the style, then expand to 200 in one shot.
