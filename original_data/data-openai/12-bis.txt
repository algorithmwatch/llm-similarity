That’s a big list. I can generate 200 distinct events, but I want to confirm two formatting details to avoid misalignment:

- BCE representation: do you want BCE years represented as negative integers in the "year" field (e.g., -0753 for 753 BCE) and the "date" field as ISO-like strings with a minus year (e.g., "-0753-01-01"), or would you prefer another convention?
- Depth: should I include a broad mix from prehistory up to the present, with some very ancient milestones (e.g., agriculture, writing) along with well-documented events in later periods, or would you prefer to limit BCE dates to widely attested points (753 BCE Rome founding, 509 BCE Roman Republic, etc.) and focus more on post-0 CE history?

If you confirm these, I’ll generate the full Python list of 200 events in one shot. If you’d rather I proceed without clarifications, I can assume BCE as negative years and proceed accordingly.
