That’s a big list. A couple of quick clarifications to make sure I format it exactly how you want:

- BCE dates: Do you want me to include them? If yes, I’ll use negative years (e.g., year -3200) and dates like "-03200-01-01" for events without precise days. If you’d prefer to avoid BCE, I can restrict to AD/CE dates only.
- Precision for ancient events: For ancient events, should I assign a placeholder day (e.g., 01) and month (e.g., 01) when only a year is known, or do you want only a year field and no date?
- Scope: Should I aim for strictly globally significant political/m Military events, or also major cultural, scientific, technological, economic, and social milestones (e.g., invention of paper, printing press, discovery of penicillin, etc.)?
- Delivery format: Do you want a single Python list containing exactly 200 dictionaries, ready to paste, or would you like it in chunks (e.g., 50 at a time) with a simple confirmation prompt to continue?

If you confirm these, I’ll generate the full 200-item Python list in the exact format you specified.
