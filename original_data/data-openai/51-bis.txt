That’s a big list! I can generate 200 widely relevant world-history events, but I want to confirm two conventions to keep BCE dates unambiguous in your requested format:

1) BCE representation in the data
- Do you want BCE dates represented as negative years in both fields, e.g., 3200 BCE as year: -3200 and date: "-3200-01-01"?
- Or would you prefer BCE years labeled with "BCE" in the event text and year kept as a positive CE-adjacent number (which would require a clearer mapping between BCE year and the date string)?

2) Date approximation
- Are you okay with approximate dates for very early events (using January 1 of the year as requested), and exact dates only for well-documented events? I can mark uncertain items with an approximate note in the event description, but you asked for concise event text—would you prefer I keep the event text strictly concise and omit explicit notes about uncertainty?

If you confirm the BCE convention (and whether to annotate uncertainties), I’ll generate a single Python list with 200 dictionaries in the exact format you specified:
[{"event": "...", "year": ..., "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}, ...]

I can proceed immediately after your reply.
