I can produce that, but I want to confirm a few details to make sure I format it exactly how you want:

- BCE dates: Do you want to include events before 1 CE? If yes, is it okay for me to use negative years (e.g., year -3100 with date "-03100-01-01") for the "year" and "date" fields?
- Date precision: Some historically significant events have approximate dates (month/day not well established). Is it acceptable to assign an approximate day (e.g., 776-07-01) or should I use a placeholder day like 0001-01-01 when unknown?
- Scope and balance: Do you want 200 events that aim for broad global coverage (multiple continents and eras) with roughly equal temporal distribution, or should I prioritize certain regions or themes (e.g., politics, science, culture) more?
- Output format: You asked for a Python list of dictionaries. Should I present it as a plain Python list (no code block) or inside a code block for readability?

If you confirm these, Iâ€™ll generate a 200-item list in the exact format you want.
