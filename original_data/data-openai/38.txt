I can generate a Python list of 200 world-historical events, each with event, year, and a full date string. A couple of quick questions to align the scope and formatting:

Questions
- BCE/BC: Do you want BCE dates included (with negative years, e.g., -3200 for 3200 BCE) or would you prefer to limit to CE/AD dates only?
- Date precision: For ancient events, should I assign widely accepted but approximate dates (e.g., a specific year with January 1 as a placeholder), or only use events with well-attested exact dates?
- Content balance: Do you want a mix across politics, science, technology, culture, religion, and conflicts, focusing on globally impactful events?

If you’re fine with a standard approach (BCE included, use best-known dates, and fill a broad mix across domains), I’ll proceed to generate the full list of 200 items. To show you the format, here is a small sample (not the full 200 yet), in the exact Python list format you asked for:

[
  {"event": "Invention of writing in Mesopotamia (cuneiform), enabling the recording of history", "year": -3200, "date": "-3200-01-01"},
  {"event": "Great Pyramid of Giza completed", "year": -2560, "date": "-2560-01-01"},
  {"event": "Birth of Alexander the Great", "year": -0356, "date": "-0356-07-01"},
  {"event": "Roman Republic established", "year": -0509, "date": "-0509-01-01"},
  {"event": "Fall of the Western Roman Empire (Romulus Augustulus deposed)", "year": 0476, "date": "0476-09-04"},
  {"event": "Birth of Muhammad", "year": 0570, "date": "0570-01-01"},
  {"event": "Crusaders capture Jerusalem", "year": 1099, "date": "1099-07-15"},
  {"event": "Magna Carta signed", "year": 1215, "date": "1215-06-15"},
  {"event": "Gutenberg invents movable-type printing (Gutenberg Bible published)", "year": 1455, "date": "1455-01-01"},
  {"event": "Columbus reaches the Americas", "year": 1492, "date": "1492-10-12"},
  {"event": "Luther's 95 Theses spark Protestant Reformation", "year": 1517, "date": "1517-10-31"},
  {"event": "Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire", "year": 1453, "date": "1453-05-29"},
  {"event": "Napoleon crowned Emperor of the French", "year": 1804, "date": "1804-05-18"},
  {"event": "World War II ends (V-J Day)", "year": 1945, "date": "1945-09-02"},
  {"event": "Moon landing (Apollo 11)", "year": 1969, "date": "1969-07-20"}
]

If you confirm the scope (especially BCE inclusion and date precision), I’ll generate the full 200-item list right away. I can also deliver it in batches (e.g., 50 items per message) if you’d prefer.
