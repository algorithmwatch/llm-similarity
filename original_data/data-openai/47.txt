I can do this, but a couple of clarifications will help me tailor the 200-entry list to what you want:

- Include BCE (before year 1) events or only AD/CE events? If you want BCE included, I can format the date field to accommodate negative years (e.g., date could be "-0776-08-01"). Is that acceptable, or would you prefer to exclude BCE entirely?
- Date precision: should I use exact dates (day, month, year) for events that have them, and approximate dates (e.g., just year or year-month) when only a year is known? If you want strict precision, I’ll limit to well-documented dates.
- Coverage balance: do you want a truly global spread (Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas, Oceania) with a mix of political, scientific, cultural, and technological milestones? Or should I weight certain domains more (e.g., science and technology) and ensure at least one event per century?
- Uniqueness: should each item be a distinct event, or is it okay to include multiple notable events within the same year (e.g., several important happenings in 1776)?
- Output format: you asked for a Python list of dicts like [{"event": "...", "year": year, "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}]. I’ll provide that exactly. Do you want the "year" field as an integer (including BCE as negative) or would you prefer a separate "century" field for BCE/CE?

If you confirm these, I’ll generate a complete 200-entry list and return a single Python list literal ready to paste into your code. To help you verify format, I can also start with a short, example chunk (e.g., 5–10 items) before I fill out the rest.
