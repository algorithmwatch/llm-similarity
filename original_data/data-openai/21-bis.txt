That’s a big request and it will be a long list. A couple quick clarifications to get it right:

- Do you want BCE dates included, or should I restrict to Common Era (CE) only?
- Is it okay if I deliver exactly 200 items, all CE (or CE+BCE if you want BCE included), with each item in the exact Python dictionary format you specified?
- If BCE is allowed, I should use astronomical year numbering for negative years (e.g., 1 BCE as year 0, 2 BCE as -1, etc.) and format the date as "-0001-01-01" or similar. Is that acceptable?

If you confirm BCE inclusion (and how you want BCE years formatted), I’ll generate a single, 200-item Python list in one go. If you’d prefer CE-only, I’ll provide a precise 200-item CE list right away.
