I can do this, but delivering 200 well-structured items is a lot of data and there are some choices that affect the dates (especially BCE dates and events with uncertain exact days). Before I generate the full list, a couple quick clarifications to make sure I match what you want:

- Should BCE dates be included? If yes, I’ll use ISO-like negative years (e.g., -0753-04-21 for 753 BCE) and put the year field as a negative integer (e.g., -753).
- For ancient events where the exact day is uncertain, would you prefer I assign a widely accepted approximate date (e.g., year-01-01) or skip uncertain days and only provide year-level dates?
- Do you want strictly globally recognized, widely cited dates, or should I include some debated dates (with notes) as well?
- Is it okay to deliver the 200 items in batches if that’s easier to review (e.g., two messages with 100 items each)?

To show you the exact format I’ll use, here is a small sample (first 5 entries) so you can confirm the style:

[
  {"event": "Founding of Rome (traditional date)", "year": -0753, "date": "-0753-04-21"},
  {"event": "Battle of Hastings", "year": 1066, "date": "1066-10-14"},
  {"event": "Magna Carta sealed", "year": 1215, "date": "1215-06-15"},
  {"event": "Columbus reaches the Americas", "year": 1492, "date": "1492-10-12"},
  {"event": "Martin Luther's 95 Theses", "year": 1517, "date": "1517-10-31"}
]

If that format and scope look right, tell me:
- whether to include BCE dates
- how to handle uncertain ancient dates (exact day vs. year-only)
- and whether you’d like me to send the full 200-item list in one go or in batches

Once you confirm, I’ll generate and return the full Python list.
