Thanks for the precise brief. I can do this, but I want to confirm two formatting choices before I generate the full 200-entry list:

1) BCE/CE encoding in the "year" and "date" fields:
- Do you want to use astronomical year numbering (where 1 BCE is year 0, 2 BCE is year -1, etc.)? If so, I’ll represent BCE dates with negative years in both the year field and the date string (e.g., year: -0320, date: "-0320-01-01").
- If you’d prefer to stick with traditional BCE/CE (no year 0), I can use negative years in the date string but still store a negative or special marker in the year field. Please specify your preference.

2) Earliest dates:
- Do you want me to include very ancient dates (e.g., around 3200 BCE and earlier) as separate entries, or should I start at, say, around 3100 BCE and move forward? Including earliest dates will help fill the 200-item target, but I want to align with your intent about “relevant to world history.”

If you confirm these two points, I’ll generate a single Python list with 200 concise events, each as a dict with keys "event", "year", and "date" (formatted like 1970-12-01, using the chosen BCE/CE convention).
