I can do this, but a couple of formatting choices will affect the output:

- Should I include BCE dates (negative years) or only CE/AD dates (positive years)?
- If BCE dates are allowed, is using a negative year in the “year” field and an ISO-like date string with a negative year in the “date” field acceptable (e.g., "-0044-03-15" for 44 BCE)?
- Do you want the list strictly chronological, or just a collection of 200 notable events (order not important)?
- Is it okay if some events have approximate dates (when exact dates aren’t known), or would you prefer only events with well-established exact dates?

If you’re good with BCE dates, I can deliver a full 200-item Python list right away (no code block needed, just the list). If you’d prefer CE-only, I can provide 200 CE-date items instead. Let me know your preference and I’ll generate the full dataset.
