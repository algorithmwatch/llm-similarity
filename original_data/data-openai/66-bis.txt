That’s a big dataset, and there are a couple of formatting choices I want to confirm so I deliver exactly what you want:

Key clarifications
- BCE representation: For events before the Common Era, do you want the year stored as a negative number in the "year" field (e.g., -3100) and the "date" field using ISO-like format with a negative year (e.g., "-3100-01-01"), i.e., astronomical year numbering? Or would you prefer a separate BCE label and non-negative year values?
- Day precision: You asked to use January 1 for approximate dates. Some well-known events have widely accepted exact dates (e.g., specific battles, coronations). Do you want me to preserve exact known dates when they’re well-established (e.g., 1066-10-14 for the Battle of Hastings) or consistently use January 1 for all entries unless you specify otherwise?
- Scope: You asked for 200 events “most relevant to world History.” That’s subjective. Do you want:
  - a broadly even distribution across regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas, Oceania) and eras, or
  - a bias toward political/military milestones, or
  - include cultural, scientific, technological, and economic milestones as well as political events?

If you confirm the above, I’ll generate the full 200-entry Python list in one shot, with:
- event: concise description
- year: integer (positive CE, negative BCE if you choose astronomical numbering)
- date: string in YYYY-MM-DD format (or with a negative year if BCE and you want astronomical numbering)

Additionally, if you’d like, I can start with a verified 40–50 item sample right away using your preferred conventions, then proceed to the full 200 once you approve the format.
