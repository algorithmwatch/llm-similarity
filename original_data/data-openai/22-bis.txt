I can generate a 200-item Python list like you asked, with BCE dates represented as negative years and CE dates as positive, using January 1 for approximate dates. A quick clarification before I generate it:

- Is it okay to use negative years for BCE (e.g., -3200 for 3200 BCE) and include a year 0 if needed for CE transitions, or would you prefer strictly no year zero (i.e., 1 BCE followed by 1 CE with no 0)?
- Do you want a particular balance of pre-CE, classical, medieval, early modern, and modern events, or should I just aim for broad global coverage across eras?

If you’re good with BCE as negative years and no special treatment for year 0, I’ll generate the full 200-item list in one shot and return it as a single Python list.
