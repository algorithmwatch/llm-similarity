I can generate that, but a couple of choices will affect how it looks and how useful it is:

- Should I include BCE (negative year) dates? If yes, I’ll encode them as negative years (e.g., year -3100, date "-03100-01-01") to cover ancient events.
- How should I handle events where the exact day is unknown? I can use year-precision with date as "YYYY-01-01" (as a placeholder), or I can omit the date for those (but you asked for a date format, so I’d default to a placeholder day).
- Do you want the list strictly historical “impactful” events, or should I mix in some cultural, scientific, and exploration milestones as well?
- Is delivering all 200 items in one go acceptable, or would you prefer batches (e.g., 50 at a time) with a progress note?

If you confirm, I can start with a first batch (e.g., 50 items) and then continue to reach 200, adjusting for your preferences.
