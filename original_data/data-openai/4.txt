Notes:
- This batch emphasizes widely recognized milestones across a broad span of world history, with precise dates where available. Some entries use approximate or widely accepted year-date combinations when exact dates are uncertain. If you want me to adjust for stricter accuracy, or to replace any items, I can. Also, I can continue with 150 more items (Batch 2, Batch 3, Batch 4) to reach a total of 200.

Would you like me to generate Batch 2 next (items 51–100)?
