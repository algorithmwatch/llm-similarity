Note: This list compiles 200 significant dates from world history, spanning prehistory to 2023. Dates before 1 AD are approximated where exact days are unknown, using January 1 for consistency in the required format. Events are selected for their broad impact on global narratives, politics, science, and society, rather than a curriculum-focused selection. For BC dates, the year is negative (e.g., -45000), and the format uses a leading zero for year 1 AD as ""0001"". Some recent events (post-2020) are included based on ongoing historical significance as of my last training data."
