Note: This list provides 200 significant dates spanning world history, selected for their broad impact on global narratives, politics, science, culture, and society. Dates for ancient events are approximate where exact days are unknown. For BCE years, the format uses negative values with leading zeros for consistency (e.g., -05000 for 50,000 BCE). Modern dates use the standard YYYY-MM-DD format. The selection emphasizes interconnected global events rather than a regional curriculum focus."
